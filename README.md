# windows-tts-button
A convenient Text-to-Speech button for Windows. (Written for Windows 10.)

This program should be pinned to the Taskbar.

This is intended for reading out short phrases or paragraphes (no more than 1,000 characters). 
It isn't intended for reading entire news articles.

The program basically Copies the currently selected text, and then Speaks that text.
To change the voice used:

- 1. Go to 'Control Panel > Ease of Access > Speech Recognition > Text to Speech > Voice Selection.' 
- 2. (Optional) More languages can be added to this dropdown through 'Settings App > Time & Language > Language > Preffered Languages.' (Ignore the 'Speech' Section in the 'Settings App', this script does not use that.)
